	<p>In the shadowy world of drone warfare, combat unfolds like a video game-only with real lives at stake. After six tours of duty, Air Force pilot Tom Egan (Ethan Hawke) yearns to get back into the
	cockpit of a real plane, but he now fights the Taliban from an air-conditioned box in the Las Vegas desert. When he and his crew start taking orders directly from the CIA, and the stakes are raised, Egan’s nerves-and
	his relationship with his wife (Mad Men’s January Jones)-begin to unravel. Revealing the psychological toll drone pilots endure as they are forced to witness the aftermath of their fight against
	insurgents, Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, Lord of War) directs this riveting insider’s view of 21st-century warfare, in which operatives target enemies from half a world away.</p>

	<p>Ethan Hawke stars as Air Force pilot Tom Egan who conducts drone strikes on terrorists in the American Homeland. This is a very stark contrast to being able to
	return home to deal with family / marital strife. The portrayal of the military in Good Kill seems rather realistic, yet I have limited exposure to that world. The idea of
	drone warfare is an emerging process that is about to be established as normal rather quickly. With political debate surrounding the issue, Good Kill provides the human
	perspective and ultimate consequences this can have on our troops. (“This ain’t f-cking PlayStation…its flesh and blood,” a commander reminds new recruits.)</p>

	<p>Even though it was based on a true story, Good Kill wants to say a lot about the current war on terror without saying much at all. It somewhat succeeds but to a rather limited effect.
	It wants the viewers to follow along and connect th r dots and we won’t be preached to. There’s a funny moment when Hawke’s character is asked by a police office, “How’s the war on terror 
	going? Hawke responds: “Kind of like your war on drugs.” (Zinger!) Of course, the movie is more than just the joke as the drama really settles in.</p>
	
	<p>Good Kill meanders through out the melodrama with some effective and heavy-handed moments with serious dramatic undertones. The fragile human cost is removed from drone operators
	controlling the robots across the world. Despite the mechanical, by the book operations of a drone, there seems to be the loss of control for the war torn and weary.</p>
