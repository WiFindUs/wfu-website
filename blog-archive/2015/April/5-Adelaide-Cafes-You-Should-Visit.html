		<h2 class="post-title">5 Adelaide Cafes You Should Visit (For The Coffee And Wi-Fi)</h2>

	<p>So, you know about the term “coffice”, don’t you? As in, coffee office.</p>
	
	<p>Those sundrenched, barista bustling cafe spaces where people hang out with their silver Macbooks propped,
	oversized headphones around necks and ceramic cup in hand. In 2015, it’s a perfectly normal scenario to take your laptop on a coffee date. In fact, it’s cool to study, write, design from cafes.</p>
	
	<p>You can’t do this in your pyjamas, but you CAN get your caffeine fix while simultaneously people watching, absorbing cafe tunes and generally spending your day in a more lively, sociable atmosphere.
	Opportunities like this are worth getting dressed for.</p>
	
	<p>After moving back from London recently, I was stoked to find plenty of ideal coffice spaces that have popped up during my extended absence,
	coaxing freelancers out of their secret hideaways and out into the world.</p>
	
	<p>So I’ve coffee-hopped, skipped, and sipped my way around town to sample coffee, suss the vibe, road test key tapping and wifi connectivity, to curate and now bring
	you this list of your must-know, go-to coffee spots.</p>
	
	<p>I’ll be upfront from the get-go and say that wifi in cafes around Adelaide is NOT a strong point. I’ve also personally found the free Adelaide-wide wifi to also be largely unreliable.
	So, at least for the mean time, securing yourself with a decent data package for personal hot-spotting your own private net connection is pretty much a non-negotiable.</p>
	
	<p>For the handful of cafes below who do offer their own fast wifi, Adelady says thank you.</p>
	
	<p>Without further ado, here are my top ten picks:</p>
	
	
	<h3>1. THE FLINDERS STREET PROJECT </h3>
	<p><span class="bold">276  Flinders Street, Adelaide SA 5000</span></p>
	
	<div class="single-portrait-container">
		<img class="img single-portrait" src="images/blog/Flinders-Street-Project.jpg" alt="THE FLINDERS STREET PROJECT "/>
	</div>
	
	
	<p>As soon as you walk into this happy, light-flooded nook, you’ll look up to the ceiling and probably struggle to look away for the entire time you’re there.
	An undulating wave of ten thousand wooden spoons are suspended from the ceiling (not that I’ve counted, but I can guarantee this installation by artist Megan Roodenry will take your breath away).</p>
	
	<p>This sets the scene in a beautiful way, and you’ll soon see, that just as much care goes into the menu, coffee and food as the interior styling. Succulents sit happily on tables, of course.</p>
	
	<p>Grab yourself a window seat for streaming light and people watching. I recommend the Clare Valley poached eggs, avocado and lime, halloumi and sourdough. Because, avocado.</p>
	
	<p>It’s a small space – expect a lineup out the door on for brunch on weekends, so keep your laptop time to weekdays and business hours, when everyone else is in their non-coffice offices.
	This place is a goodie. You’ll get friendly service always (and tell the lovely waitress Louise that I sent you!)</p>

	<h3>2. SAD  CAFE</h3>
	<p><span class="bold">Shop 4 Ebenezer Place, Adelaide SA 5000</span></p>
	
	<div class="single-landscape-container">
		<img class="img single-landscape" src="images/blog/Sad-Cafe.jpg" alt="SAD CAFE"/>
	</div>
	
	
	<p>Don’t be put off by the name – this indie cool eatery will make you anything but sad (and just to spell it out, SAD cafe is an anagram neighbouring DAS hair boutique).</p>
	
	<p>The mission of this cafe is: as fresh as possible, as local as possible and as simple as possible. Pretty good, right?</p>
	
	<p>The arthropod wall art makes you feel like you’ve stepped inside a biologist’s living room, but the spinning vinyl, stack of Wallpaper city guides and the big, rickety
	communal table will make you feel totally comfortable with this.</p>
	
	<p>The coffee is en pointe.</p>
	
	<ul>

	<h3>3. E FOR ETHEL</h3>
	<p><span class="bold">116 Melbourne Street, North Adelaide SA 5006</span></p>
	
	<div class="single-landscape-container">
		<img class="img single-landscape" src="images/blog/E-For-Ethel.jpg" alt="E FOR ETHEL"/>
	</div>
	
	
	<p>Ethel is the kind of new-age, on-trend but endearingly old-school Aunty you always wish you had.
	She welcomes you inside with a big smile, ushers you to her retro table, gives you chocolate freckles and quirky love notes with your coffee,
	plays the latest tunes and has a killer cupboard of artisan, locally crafted pressies that you wish you could take home. And you’ll leave feeling like you’ve had a big, warming, you’ve got this kind of hug.</p>
	
	<p>Owners and sweethearts, Amanda Matulick and Dan Harland are seriously, hands to heart, the loveliest couple in all of Adelaide. Nestled in a cosy corner of Melbourne street,
	there’s dappled vineyard light, food made with big love (and offered in plentiful servings) – it’s like finding hidden treasure.</p>
	
	<p>Local is celebrated at E for Ethel. Amanda seems to know everyone in Adelaide, and she’ll hook you up with whoever, or whatever you might need. We follow each other on Instagram (of course)
	and Amanda always seems to remember the latest adventure I’ve been on, or happening in my world.</p>
	
	<p>E for Ethel stocks an ever-growing range Australian, Handmade and Sustainable gift products that embody modern Australian design, inspired style and local manufacture.
	I’m grateful to stock my art prints + stationery goodies in store, among some really beautiful company of other local makers.</p>
	
	<p>Ethel, I’m charmed.</p>

	<h3>4. EXCHANGE SPECIALTY COFFEE</h3>
	<p><span class="bold">Shops 1 & 2, 12 – 18 Vardon Avenue Adelaide SA 5000</span></p>
	
	<div class="single-landscape-container">
		<img class="img single-landscape" src="images/blog/Exchange-Specialty-Coffee.jpg" alt="EXCHANGE SPECIALTY COFFEE"/>
	</div>
	
	
	<p>This little nook has a certain je ne sais quoi specialty about it. Owner Thomas Roden returned from the UK (where he worked at Workshop Coffee Co.
	– only one of London’s best) to bring a little taste of London home, and he’s executed this plan brilliantly.</p>
	
	<p>In Thomas’s words, “We have two simple goals: to serve exceptional espresso, filter coffee and tea, and to provide genuine hospitality and rewarding experiences.”</p>
	
	<p>What more could you want in a cafe? I love this place because it is clean, simple, stylish and no fuss. There’s also a perfect curation of artsy magazines suspended
	on string. And the location – nestled in quaint Ebenezer Place – makes it the perfect spot to tap keys from.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<lh><span class="bold">IN  SUMMARY:</span></lh>
		<li>VIBE :: relaxed, stylish, no fuss</li>
		<li>COFFEE :: 5 stars, Market Lane</li>
		<li>PARKING :: Rundle Street ticket parking + Bent Street carpark building</li>
		<li> WI-FI :: Adelaide City free wifi</li>
		<li>POWER POINTS :: NO</li>

	</ul>
	
	
	
	
	<h3>5. MISTER  SUNSHINE’S</h3>
	<p><span class="bold">32 George Street, Thebarton SA 5031</span></p>
	
	<div class="single-landscape-container">
		<img class="img single-landscape" src="images/blog/Mister-Sunshines.jpg" alt="MISTER  SUNSHINE’S"/>
	</div>
	
	
	<p>This place – it’s joy. It’s also kitschy cute retro quirk, with succulents in tea cups… and don’t get me started on the smashed avo.</p>
	
	<p>And while I’m sure it’s been said by everyone who has ever visited, owner Edwin Comey is literally mister sunshine personified.</p>
	
	<p>Never have I before experienced such a warm, loving, neighbourly welcome in a cafe. It’s your home away from home – and you won’t even have to do the dishes.</p>
	
	<p>The backstory: owners Edwin Comey and Prue Olsen traipsed around Australia by van, with their young daughter Edith to suss out the coolest cafes around, note their best features
	and bring all of the best bits into this cafe. And that, they have. Look for the bright yellow door.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<lh><span class="bold">IN  SUMMARY:</span></lh>
		<li>VIBE :: happy, retro, casual</li>
		<li>COFFEE :: 4 stars, DeGroot Coffee</li>
		<li>PARKING :: ample street parking</li>
		<li> WI-FI :: NO – bring your own</li>
		<li>POWER POINTS :: NO</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MisterSunshines" target="_blank">Facebook</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	
	
	<p>So there you have it. Happy coffice days ahead! Now, over to you! Where’s your favourite coffee in Adelaide? Anywhere else that we should know about? Emma Kate xx</p>
