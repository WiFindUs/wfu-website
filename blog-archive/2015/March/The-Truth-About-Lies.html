	<p>“Lying is a cooperative act,” says professional lie detector Pamela Meyer (TED Talk: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/pamela_meyer_how_to_spot_a_liar" target="_blank">How to spot a liar</a>).
	“Think about it, a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie.” Meyer works to help people see the sheer ubiquity of the falsehoods we tell and hear — and gives advice on how
	we might start to combat deception. Dive into her 17 favorite books about truth, dishonesty, and all the gray areas in between.</p>
