	<p>The Diamond Light is a staple in the Los Angeles music scene. A must-see when you’re in town. Their must-jam kinda sound has always
	carried with it unique, honest lyrics followed by a myriad of powerful melodic changes and bass licks that keep the heavy, steady drums working hard.</p>
	
	<p>I’ve been watching these guys for a while now, and they continue to get stronger in their sound and presence. I remember attending shows in the developmental
	years when they were young college lads still finding their way. They’ve never shied away from growing and expanding in sound, searching for new mountains to climb,
	and recently, they’ve been executing business with more mastery than ever.</p>
	
	<p>Seriously. This time, they’ve really upped the ante. Their new EP, <span class="bold italic">Vicious Visions</span>, is all over the awesome freakin’ place. Streaming through it, I was very happy to
	hear that these guys still deliver true rock music with plain, raw, beautiful musicianship. The songs have an eclectic flavor to them, and they keep you steadily rocking/nodding
	your head with approval. It’s a perfect concoction of vibes. Love, fear, conviction — all the goodies.</p>

	<p>The first track, “<span class="bold italic">Vicious Visions</span>,” begins with sounds reminiscent of war-like psychedelia and drums that instantly
	arouse your interest. After a few seconds of anticipation, lead singer Griffin’s soulful, grungy, somewhat-poppy voice sings, “<span class="italic">Listen to your heart beat.</span>” It
	captivated me to the point where I actually listened to my heart beat. I felt it, too. It felt good. As a matter of fact, my heart felt so good from the first beat of this EP that
	I almost wanted to dance along with it as we continued to jam through the tunes together. The first song assures the listener that the musical endeavor
	they’re about to experience is enthralling and extremely palatable.</p>
	
	<p>Let’s talk about the song “<span class="bold italic">Peculiar Way</span>.” It’s got heavy riffs and vocal attacks from all angles. It’s the kind of song that would probably make
	<span class="bold">The Black Keys</span> say, “<span class="italic">Now THAT’s cool!</span>” I mean, really, they (along with many other rock bands) should take notes.
	I imagine even Mark Bolan of T-Rex would love a song like this.</p>
	
	<p>Look out for these dudes in 2015 and beyond. With such a strong delivery, it’s only a matter of time before they outgrow venues like <a href="http://thesatellitela.com/" target="_blank">The Satellite</a>
	and <a href="http://bootlegtheater.org/" target="_blank">The Bootleg</a>. Bringing back blues, soul, and rock ‘n roll is a serious goal (no rhyme intended), and these guys do it with style and finesse. The strength
	of the new EP mirrors the power and momentum the band has gained over the last few years. As they continue to play all over Los Angeles, you should hop on the DL train before it’s too late and the price of admission skyrockets.</p>
